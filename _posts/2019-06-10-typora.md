A good friend of mine pasted this editor on to me and I can not believe how easy it makes some of the blog writing I have been attempting to do recently.

My aim with this bit of software is to create a easy note taking system for building draft blogs and manuscripts quickly and effectively. 

Normally when doing these sorts of simple drafts I like to use a note pad and pen however this can be quite time consuming when many of the valuable “grey” literature that I look at can only be found on the web. There are many note taking tools out there but as I have played around with many of them ([evernote](), onenote, google keep etc etc) I realise that I only need a simple markdown note-taking app that I can build my drafts with. For now I am only focusing on making it flow with draft blogs and manuscripts but as I find a decent solution I am looking forward to being able to take control of my notes and data associated with it from any one of the third party options above (e.g evernote which I am currently using at a cost to my bank account).

## Background

As I am slowly migrating from a closed, "windows dependent" scientific workflow towards a slightly "less" dependent open-science system I miss many key tools and workflows from the "data-science" world. This was one of these obvious moments. When I started looking into `.rmd` and `.md` files I found a huge number of "text editors" that could do the job:

### [25 Best Markdown editors for Windows as of 2019 - Slant](https://www.slant.co/topics/1852/~best-markdown-editors-for-windows)

### [4 open source Markdown editors | Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/11/markdown-editors)

So there were just a few to get side tracked with however in the spirit of focus I stuck with `vs-code` for R integration reasons. But as I found out not long ago, `Typora` is a markdown editor that is really good. AND easy....
