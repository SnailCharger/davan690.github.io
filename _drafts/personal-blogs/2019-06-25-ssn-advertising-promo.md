May is NZ music month and doing a PhD in Australia seems to highlight the lack of a true "nationwide" backing of grass-roots talent. For music in particular, the support of [triple-j] as a platform for up and coming Australian talent to get air-time is amazing to me as a kiwi. In NZ we have music month (May) and have sections/shows involving up and coming artists but this seems minimal compared to 'triple-j'. I like to think it is a numbers game, where Australia has millions and NZ only has a few million so we just don't have the masses.

However, as my timing is always prefect and it is no longer MAY .... here is some good acoustic music from Lara Rose. Lara is a kiwi living in Dunedin, NZ.
